Topic(Problem Statement)- To create an app that deals with the safety and security of girls
Introduction- My idea is to create an app that deals with the safety and security of girls in the present era. Every now and then we hear about a girl being harassed and the fihures are going from bad to worse. As computer science students the role comes on our part to provide them with a safer society with the advancement in technologies.
Solution- Create an app that sends the location of the person in trouble along with all other details to the nearest police station so that instant help is available.An alternate solution can be send a call automatically to the police station when a button is pressed.
